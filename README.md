I have displayed output on seven segment displays. I wired 2 7-segment displays to an Arduino using 2 BCD to 7 segment decoders with a potentiometer. I then attempted to program the 2 7-segment displays to display a number between 0 and 99 based on the potentiometers' position. I started off by connecting the 5V to the positive terminal and the GND to the negative terminal. Then, I connected the power and the Digital PWM values (0 to -7) to the Inputs of the Segment displays. After that, I connected each corresponding letter from the Segment displays to the Segment decoders. After that, I connected the resistors to the negative terminals of the breadboard. Lastly, I connected the potentiometer's wiper to Analog A5. Through this software, I was able to display a number between 0 and 99.
